>I would not expect oakum to last very long in the location that by the 1900s had largely settled on a cast iron piston ring and would remain so in most piston engines until modern alloys took over. Regardless of packing direction, surface roughness in the cylinder would tend to tear the fibers apart and smear the pieces all along the cylinder where they would get washed away by wet steam. I would wager that the successful engines used leather for the piston rings for its greater abrasion resistance, but it would still be short-lived compared to the cast iron rings that came to dominate the use case.

>Oakum was and still is a possibility for packing glands to seal piston and valve rods, the rod in question polished as smooth as you can get. Also valid for this use case would be asbestos, and later on you could purchase high temperature synthetic fibers that had been prepared in a rope-like form for ease of installation. I've serviced more than a few steam glands using rope type seals, but ultimately the modern high temp rubber dominates newer applications and repacks for vintage ones.
