# Properties:
Thermal property
The theoretical thermal conductivity of AlN is 320W/m•K, the thermal conductivity of the prepared polycrystalline AlN is generally 100~260W/m•K, and the room temperature thermal conductivity is 10~15 times that of Al2O3, which is close to BeO ( The theoretical thermal conductivity is 350W/m K), and when the temperature is higher than 200℃, the thermal conductivity is better than that of beryllium oxide; in the range of 25~400℃, the thermal expansion coefficient of pure AIN is 4.4×10-6K- 1, similar to the thermal expansion coefficient of silicon (3.4×10-6K-1).
